Extra Credit Information: We made several changes in the enhanced mode. You start out the same way on level 1, there is background music and other new sounds. 
After you get through level one there are tokens that start appearing. There are 5 different kinds of tokens, The Nuke token which is marked by the big 'N' which gives 
you the ability to make a giant explosion. The 'S' token which starts up a sheild that will destroy anything in your path as you fly around. 
the 'D' token which gives you a heat seeking drone, it locks onto a target and will eventually explode if it doesn't hit it which releases 2 smaller missiles that will expire shortly
The '+' token which gives you a new life and the 'X' token which gives you Mines you can place. The mines are invincible so if anything hits them it will destroy whatever hits it. 
After 3 seconds the mine gives a short burst of an explosions. As you play through the game you will have more tokens appear, as you die and as you level up.
